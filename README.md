# JAVA-9MI
Documentation of my journey to become a better java programmer! This repository documents some of the projects I have done in school along with my reflection of these projects. This repository only includes the projects I've done in my 6th ~ 9th months with coding (hence 9MI [9 Months In]!), so that I could better document my progression.

This repository is the sequel to both JAVA 3MI and JAVA 6MI!

Similar to the two previous repository, Reflection include:

- What I've learned from doing the project
- What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment
- Note to future Warren (lol)
