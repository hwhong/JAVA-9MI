What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project was really challenging as it was lengthy and the bugs were hard to find. I learned much about the linkedList 
data structure and how I could implementing a LinkedList that performs in a circular manner. The idea of creating an inner
class was something that is quite new to me. I think it will be pretty useful in the future. 

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- I think the most trouble I had was with setting the link between each node, and also thinking of all the edge cases that I 
may encounter. I had a little bug with setting the link of head dummy node, turns out the bug was in the constructor all along.

Note to future Warren (lol)
- After knowing that the bug was in the constructor (a place where you never thought something could go wrong), you should be
more careful when you debug, don't eliminate any "obvious choice" as the bug may just be in there.
